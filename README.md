## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn patterns in telecommunications data using machine learning techniques. The workflow includes:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering
- Model training (Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers)
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Feature importance analysis

## Dataset
The dataset used is the [Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn), containing information about:
- Customer demographics
- Services subscribed
- Account information
- Churn status (target variable)

## Installation
